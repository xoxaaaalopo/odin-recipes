        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe gives the bones for a delicious, classic fried rice, yet it’s also a great starting point to making a variation of your own.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice: Cold, leftover rice — preferably day-old cooked rice — is essential to a great fried rice. Freshly cooked rice is too fluffy and moist. You’ll want your rice to be as dry as possible, which ensures that the granules are separated to yield the right texture.</li>
            <li>Eggs: A common addition to fried rice. These get scrambled into fluffy curds that are evenly distributed throughout.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook your veg. Stir-fry garlic, scallion whites, peas, and carrots in a large wok or nonstick frying pan.</li>  
            <li>Add the rice. Make sure to break up any clumps, toss to combine, and add your seasonings.</li>
            <li>Scramble the eggs. Push the fried rice to one side of the pan, then add your eggs to the other side. The eggs are scrambled in the pan while they’re getting slowly cooked, and then folded into the fried rice to finish. (This technique is used in a lot of stir-fries and dry noodle dishes, and it’s really fun to do too!)</li>
            <li>Finish the fried rice. Drizzle with sesame oil and garnish with scallion greens.</li>
        </ol>
