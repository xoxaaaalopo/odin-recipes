        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground Beef: For a truly flavorful, tender, and juicy burger, go for ground beef with a fat content of around 20%.</li>
            <li>Small Onion: White, yellow, and red onions will all work so use your favorite.</li>
            <li>Large Egg: Helps to hold the burger together and adds flavor.</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs: Your favorite brand or flavor will work and don't forget about panko!</li>
            <li>Dijon or Yellow Mustard: For a bit of spice in your burger patty.</li>
            <li>Worcestershire Sauce: Adds a little savory and smoky flavor.</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder: Fresh minced garlic will work in a pinch but with burgers, I always prefer to use garlic powder because you can taste garlic everywhere.</li>
            <li>Hamburger Buns - The perfect old-fashioned burger requires a soft, sturdy, and slightly toasted hamburger bun, usually with sesame seeds on top, that can hold all the toppings without falling apart.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the egg in a large bowl and add the bread crumbs, garlic powder, onion, mustard, salt, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and beef.</li>  
            <li>Mix the meat mixture together and shape the mixture into four three-quarter-inch thick patties.</li>
            <li>Place the burger patties in a preheated pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Cook the burgers for about 5 minutes per side or until no longer pink inside.</li>
